# Polyglot Puzzle â€“ Mobile Game Plan

Polyglot Puzzle is a hybrid block-puzzle + language-learning mobile game implemented in Flutter.

This repository contains a Clean-Architecture skeleton ready for further development, including:

1. Core game mechanics (8Ã—8 grid, Tetromino pieces, line clearing, scoring)
2. Language-learning integration hooks (SM-2 spaced repetition, SQLite + Supabase sync)
3. Monetisation stubs (Google AdMob, in-app purchases)

## Structure

```
polyglot_puzzle_flutter/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # Pure business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Persistence & external APIs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ presentation/   # UI widgets & view-models
â”œâ”€â”€ test/               # Unit & widget tests
â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml        # Dependencies
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Flutter SDK â‰¥ 3.19 first
flutter pub get
flutter run     # Run on connected device / emulator
```

## Next Steps

â€“ Complete gesture input for drag-and-drop piece placement with haptics.<br>
â€“ Implement piece preview + queue.<br>
â€“ Wire up language service to fetch / assign vocabulary.<br>
â€“ Integrate Google Mobile Ads + in_app_purchase flows.
